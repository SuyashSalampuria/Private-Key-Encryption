# Private-Key-Encryption

### Diffie - Hellman key exchange algorithm
Diffie-Hellman key exchange, also called exponential key exchange, is a method of digital encryption that uses numbers raised to specific powers to produce decryption keys on the basis of components that are never directly transmitted, making the task of a would-be code breaker mathematically overwhelming.

### The Problem
But as a truly random cannot be generated by a computer, the key generated is not exactly random and hence can be compromised.

### Solution
We generate the key using random movement of pointer by the user.
